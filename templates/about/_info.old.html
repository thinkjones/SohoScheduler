        <h2>What is the S.O.H.O. Scheduler?</h2>
		The S.O.H.O. Scheduler literally means "Small Office - Home Office Scheduling Application".  
		It is a small business accounting application for individuals in the service scheduling industry.  For instance if you run a small
		business that requires the booking of appointments and the scheduling of service personnel this maybe the application for you.

    <p>
        <h2>What Industry Types Would This Be Used For?</h2>
		The application has been developed in a fairly generic way allowing it to be utilised in a number of different industries.  
		The original intention was for use in a small pre-booking taxi company, however it could be used in a number of industries.
		<br />
		Some examples are:
        <ul>
          <li>Plumbers
          <li>Taxi Drivers
          <li>Tow-Truck Operators
          <li>Cab Drivers
		  <li>Air Conditioning Booking
        </ul>
    </p>
	<br />

        <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
        At present it is free and for the functionalty we offer at signup will always be free for as long as we can afford to run the service.
		Because it is free we do not offer any guarantee of service, backup or consistency of service.  However if we get enough interest we will start to add
		a more professional service for a small fee.
